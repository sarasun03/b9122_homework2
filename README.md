This repository includes 2 files: 1) the webcrawler code that we covered in class, and 2) the webcrawler code files I created in Question 1 of Homework 2. The first file is a py. file, while the second is a .ipynb file.

For the webcrawler code files of Homework 2, there are two webcrawlers in it.
<li> The first webcrawler crawls pages with their seed url being https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm (the press releases page of the Federal Reserve System) and collects pages that contain the word “covid” found within them. The output will be 10 urls of such webpages.
<li> The second webcrawler crawls pages with their seed url being https://www.sec.gov/news/pressreleases (the press releases page of the Securities and Exchange Commission) and collects urls of press releases that contain the word "charges." The output will be the first 20 urls found, along with the corresponding url text.
